This is an analysis of adidas sales in USA (2020-2021). Excel was used for this analysis.
## Data Sourcing 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/adidas-sales-dataset) used was gotten from kaggle. It consist of 9652 rows and 14 columns.
## Data cleaning 
* Ensured there were no duplicates in the data.
* Ensured the columns were in their appropriate data type.
## Data Analysis, Insights and Recommendations 
I created pivot tables and charts to analyze and visualize the data.
The following insights were uncovered 
* There was a significant increase in sales in the year 2021 compared to 2020. The low sales in 2020 could have been because of the COVID-19 in that year.
* The highest monthly total sales was recorded in the month of July 2021.
